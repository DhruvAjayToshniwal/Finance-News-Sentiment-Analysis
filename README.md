# Financial News Sentiment Analysis

This project uses the GNews API to fetch recent financial news articles, the OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate summaries of these articles, and the Hugging Face Transformers library to perform sentiment analysis on these summaries. The sentiment scores are then visualized over time using Plotly.

## Installation

Before running the script, you will need to install several Python libraries. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

pip install requests pandas plotly openai transformers


## Usage

To use this script, you need API keys for GNews and OpenAI. Replace `'your-gnews-api-key'` and `'your-openai-api-key'` in the script with your actual API keys.

You can run the script in a Jupyter notebook, or in any Python environment that supports Plotly. The script fetches the most recent articles related to a list of queries, generates summaries of these articles, performs sentiment analysis on the summaries, and creates an interactive Plotly line plot of the sentiment scores over time.

The default queries are 'finance', 'economy', and 'bitcoin', but you can replace these with any queries of your choice. For each query, the script generates a separate line plot.

Note: The sentiment scores are determined by the sentiment analysis pipeline of the Hugging Face Transformers library, which may not always perfectly reflect the sentiment of an article. The sentiment analysis is performed on a summary of the article generated by the OpenAI API, not the full article text.
